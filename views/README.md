# The Mocha Storehouse Business Directory

## Decription:

This concept has been in the making for over a decade. My wife and I met in college in Tampa, FL at the University of South Florida; both of us originating from the east coast of Florida, we had to start over with finding all the essential businesses. Where is a black barbershop or a black hair beauty salon?! Every time we moved, we relied on word-of-mouth referals from aquaintances and we had to go and vet them for ourselves. What if there was a way for us to create a directory of black and brown buisness, that held a particular standard of excellent customer service, products and marketing. We've made attempst to launch versions of this before but now that software engeneeering is my career, suddenly the possibilities for The Mocha Storehouse seem endless! Check out the first interation of the website compiled together in less than a week.

<!-- ##  General
    Game Instructions:
### Press the Engage! button to start the game. 

>THE DECK
>>The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player has their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

>THE PLAY
>>Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card adds both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their stack. If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles (eight cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, the war status continues until the tie is broken or a player runs out of cards, which would be a loss.

>HOW TO KEEP SCORE
>>The score is kept numerically between the players two decks. The game ends when one player has all 52 cards.
