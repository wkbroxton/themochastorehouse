# The Mocha Storehouse Business Directory

## Decription:

This concept has been in the making for over a decade. My wife and I met in college in Tampa, FL at the University of South Florida; both of us originating from the east coast of Florida, we had to start over with finding all the essential businesses. Where is a black barbershop or a black hair beauty salon?! Every time we moved, we relied on word-of-mouth referals from aquaintances and we had to go and vet them for ourselves. What if there was a way for us to create a directory of black and brown buisness, that held a particular standard of excellent customer service, products and marketing. We've made attempst to launch versions of this before but now that software engeneeering is my career, suddenly the possibilities for The Mocha Storehouse seem endless! Check out the first interation of the website compiled together in less than a week.
