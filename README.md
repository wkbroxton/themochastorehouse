# The Mocha Storehouse Business Directory

## Description:

This concept has been a dream passion project for years. We've talked through it countless times and attempted it once over a decade ago. My wife and I met in college at the University of South Florida; both of us relocated to the Tampa Bay area from other distant parts of Florida. We, like many others, had to start over with finding all the essential and culturally relevant businesses. Where is the best black barbershop or beauty salon?! Do they give razor-sharp edges or specialize in natural hair? Every time we moved (which we did quite a bit for school or our careers), we started from scratch and relied on word-of-mouth referrals from strangers and acquaintances alike.  But tastes and standards vary, and we had to go through the painful process of vetting whether say, a Jamaican restaurant was our standard of good. What if there was a way for us to create a directory of black and brown businesses, that captured both word of mouth and operated as a marketing platform for niche and minority-owned businesses. A platform for locals, transplants, and travelers alike that is cultivated for da culture. We've made attempts to launch versions of this before but now that software engineering is my career and I dare say my talent, suddenly the possibilities for The Mocha Storehouse seem tangible and boundless! Check out the first iteration of the website compiled together in less than a week.

## Next Steps: Planned future enhancements: 

    AAU & General Icebox Items:
    
* AAU, I like to click specific categories of businesses to explore.
* AAU, I'd like to show the progression of reviews, if modifications are made.
* AAV, I'd like to have categories for each business want to see the types of businesses available to see if any meet my needs.
* AAU, I'd like to be able to see and search business by category.
* Display an informatonal key for specifics on Business Categories.

In the Future, we see additional opportunities:
* Businesses can claim and own their page.
* Future partnerships with say Doordash and others for ordering.
* Premium marketing add on services.
